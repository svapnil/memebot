# Memebot

A discord bot that plays memes in the chat based off messages that happen in the discord server.

Some of these are inside jokes, others are memes that exist on tiktok, etc. 

## Adding a Meme

Memes can be added to the `meme_config.py` file on the `REGEX_TO_MEME` variable.

## Dependencies

These programs are necessary to do audio encoding that we display in Discord:
`opus`
`ffmpeg`
